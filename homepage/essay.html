Before me, tall, thick, metal bars stood their ground. It glared with expressions of disapproval every time I took a glimpse at their direction and walked past it. Their gates rapidly creaked shut and the mortice deadlocks on them were used against me for the first time since my attendance at this Parish. This is what happens when you&rsquo;ve lost someone&rsquo;s trust. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c0">On Mott St is an old, Georgian architectural building that passersby often turn a blind eye to. Yet, I find myself recollecting the times we&rsquo;ve gathered here every Sunday, for it was a duty and a routine we followed. We learned to feel belonging in this building and found our resemblances to others here. For some, it might have been the first place in the city where we successfully found people who are mirror images of one another. After all, don&rsquo;t all Catholics learn to get along? Our lives practically depend on the same holy figure whom we exist to worship to become His chosen ones.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Being a Catholic believer allowed me to associate myself with other Catholic followers. As others read through the Gospels by </span><span class="c0 c3">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to learn about God&rsquo;s revelation, I also glanced over the Gospel to learn about God&rsquo;s revelation. As they gloriously chanted the lyrics of </span><span class="c0 c3">Our Father</span><span class="c0">, I briefly cited the lyrics of other liturgical music. And as they praised God&rsquo;s teachings from the </span><span class="c0 c3">Old and New Testaments</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to non-religious folks, I was expected to imitate their same actions. It was a great bonding mechanism thereof, that we Catholics felt safe, comfortable, and judgment-free in this Parish community and didn&rsquo;t have to pretend to be people we&rsquo;re not. That is if only I hadn&#39;t questioned the values of the Church or mortified the heavenly Father by being present at his place of worship back then.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">The gates of this Church are usually wide and welcoming; everyone is encouraged to walk through and experience God&rsquo;s goodwill. </span><span class="c0">As Catholics, weekly masses are significant to prove our respect. It is considered sinful to miss a Sunday or </span><span class="c0 c3">Holy Day</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;without a sensible excuse. Mass is the central worship, consisting of chants, readings, and prayers to appropriately celebrate the </span><span class="c0 c3">Eucharist</span><span class="c0">, Jesus&rsquo;s body and blood. In a compacted, two-story public space, people gather to present their solemnity and find peace for a relatively long sixty minutes. The ceremonies are casually interrupted by wailing babies, active toddlers who run on the sanctuary (which is forbidden during mass), and ringing phones that were supposed to be silenced before mass began, and I thank them for their obstructions.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c0">This, however, is an event a decade old from my childhood. I consider myself a lapsed Catholic. Although all my memories and connections made at this Church, whether positive or negative, will always be cherished, I cannot allow myself to continue simulating the behaviors of a true Catholic when I no longer find meaning in being one. The Church of the Transfiguration will always persevere on the same Mott St in the Lower East Side. Its gates will continue to welcome newcomers and old comers who have come back to seek forgiveness, but with the diversity found in the city, it&rsquo;s expected that not everyone will want to enter. It just may not suit some the same way it does for others. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c0">Being a part of this community took commitment. It meant waking up early each Sunday to listen to the priest rant nonsense while the rest of us were seated, always on the verge of falling asleep during mass, and having to continue this cycle for the rest of our lives. Three-quarters of the time, the principles taught at Parochial schools and in Bible readings sounded like complete gibberish to me. Why put limitations on yourself and constantly bleed your ears listening to &ldquo;homosexuality is sinful&rdquo; or &ldquo;abortion will send you to hell&rdquo; when you can live freely, away from restrictions and encountering hindrances? I would never understand, but at the end of the day, to grow up in a diverse city means accepting things around us. Not everyone can be our mirror and not everyone will want to be. The Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church is just another one of many places where a group of people in a manifold identity-found city can call home.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">I, for one, had stopped allowing Catholic teachings to influence my beliefs on everything around me. I boldly decline what the Parish considers &ldquo;sins&rdquo; if it means being able to isolate myself from being ordered around by an unknown authoritarian figure. Still, each time I walk past the old, Georgian architectural property, I respectfully give a 90-degree bow in front of a sculpture of Jesus and make the </span><span class="c0 c3">sign of the cross</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the part of my experience it has fulfilled.</span></p></body></html>
